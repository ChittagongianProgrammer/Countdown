# Countdown
 Here is a README.md file summarizing the two Jupyter notebooks:

## Countdown.ipynb

This notebook contains a simple countdown timer program. 

It allows the user to input a time in seconds, and prints a countdown displaying the hours, minutes, and seconds remaining. Once the countdown reaches 0, it prints "IT IS OVER!".

Concepts demonstrated:

- Input validation
- Time calculations
- Formatted print statements 
- for loops
- Sleep function

## For Loops.ipynb

This notebook demonstrates several examples of for loops in Python.

Concepts shown:

- Simple for loop iterating from 1 to 10
- Using break and continue in loops
- Nesting for loops to print a rectangle of a given width/height

Overall, these notebooks aim to provide simple examples of common Python programming concepts. The countdown timer shows a full program example, while the for loops notebook focuses specifically on loop concepts.
